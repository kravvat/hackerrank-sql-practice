# HackerRank SQL Practice

This repository contains my personal SQL practice solutions from the [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql) platform.  
All tasks are grouped by difficulty level, with clean and well-commented SQL code.

> ⚠️ Original problem statements are not included, in accordance with HackerRank's content policy.  
> Only summaries and my solutions are provided.

## 📁 Folder structure

- `basic/` – Fundamental SQL tasks: selecting, filtering, sorting, simple joins.
- `intermediate/` – Moderate-level challenges involving grouping, aggregation, nested queries.
- `advanced/` – Complex logic, multi-step problems, advanced subqueries or optimizations.

As I progress, the structure and topics may evolve depending on the challenges I solve.

Each file includes:
- a short summary of the task,
- a simplified table schema (if needed),
- a working MySQL-compatible solution.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- SQL (MySQL dialect)
- Executed and tested locally or in online environments (e.g. HackerRank, DB Fiddle)

You can run the queries using:
- MySQL CLI / Workbench
- DB Fiddle: [https://www.db-fiddle.com/](https://www.db-fiddle.com/)
- Other SQL playgrounds that support MySQL

## 🚀 My goal

I'm using this repository to:
- document my SQL learning journey,
- prepare for technical interviews,
- build a clean and accessible portfolio of SQL solutions.
